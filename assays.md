We have established a series of targets from across academia and are focussing on 8 targets from the following disease areas:
1. Anti-microbial resistance
2. Dementia / Alzheimers
3. Cancer

These will be screened by XChem and 

Currently the targets developed and screened / being screend by Ox XChem are:

1. Sonic Hedgehog (screened)
2. mammalian ER alpha-glucosidase II (screened)
3. VIM2 (screeened) 
4. OXA10 (screened)
5. DPSYL2 (in progress)
6. PCAF-HAT  (in progress)
7. USP8  (in progress)
8. FIH (de-oxygenase)  (in progress)
9. TgPLP1 (in progress)
10. KDM5B (JARID1B)  (in progress)
11. PBP5  (in progress)

Binding and activity assays are needed to experimentally confirm the compounds synthesie bind and design the next round of SAR.
In this domain Ox XChem is developing collaborations with external groups to perform the required assays.
**If you're an assay group (e.g. SPR, NMR, AlphaScreen) and interested in working with us - please get in touch.**
