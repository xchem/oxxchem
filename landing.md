There is a need for greater throughput in follow-up chemistry and more tractable chemical starting points. To tackle this we have developed:

1. A diverse fragment library containing chemistry from UK academia has been developed and is being extended
2. A chemistry facility in the Research Complex at Harwell (RCaH) has been established
3. Collaborations with UK and Chinese academics to produce follow up chemistry

We hope to extend this to further groups. So if you are a chemist - interested in contributing compounds to screen - please get in touch.
