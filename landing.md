There is a need for greater throughput in follow-up chemistry and more tractable chemical starting points. To tackle this we have developed:

1. A diverse fragment library containing chemistry from UK academia (this is always being extended)
2. A chemistry facility in the Research Complex at Harwell (RCaH) 
3. Collaborations with UK and Chinese academics to produce follow up chemistry

We hope to extend this to further groups.

**If you are a chemist - interested in contributing compounds to screen or synthesising follow-ups - please get in touch.**
