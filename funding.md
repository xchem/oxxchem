### Data policy
It is a requirement of our funding to publicly release all data and methods generated using our funding. Furthermore, no IP can be generated directly from any materials or methods generated using our funding.
 
#### Data policy working rules:
1. Compound structures and target names used by Ox XChem for screening will be released publicly on the website by December 2018
2. Compound and material providers will have first refusal to exclusively work on any data generated by Ox XChem activities
3. If first refusal is declined or no response is heard within 3 months, data will be passed to other potential Ox XChem collaborators
4. All screening data* will be released publicly - on the Ox XChem website or other sources (e.g. the PDB) by December 2018 or up to 6 months (whichever is longest)
5. Upon publication, all data will be released publicly - on the Ox XChem website or other sources
6. Work will be published in open-access journals under accordance with Wellcome Trust rules - by default WellcomeOpenResearch
 
### Authorship policy
If publications are written using data generated through Ox XChem - all material providers and scientific contributors will be included on the final publication.For example the compound provider(s), target provider(s) and XChem contact person(s) carrying out screen would all be included
 
Data is defined as: 3D protein-ligand coordinates, construct sequence, raw and refined crystallographic data
