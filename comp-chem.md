We aim to and enable Diamond users to use computational tools to perform the analysis needed to progress an FBDD program. e.g. Tools for  selecting hits to follow-up on, enumerating follow-ups and then scoring them. 
A core focus is integrating a wide-range of academic and commercial tools and working closely with pharma to create a national resource for computational chemistry.

1. A dedicated space at the Research Complex at Harwell for computational analysis - including bespoke tools and hardware
2. Collaborarions with software providers [DesertSci](http://www.desertsci.com/products/proasis4/) and [InformaticsMatters](https://squonk.it/) to provide cutting edge softwarefor Diamond users 
3. Working with academics, pharma CADD groups and industrial software providers to establish best practice and then build tools that extend it through [CCP CompMedChem](https://ccp-cmc.github.io/)

If you're a computational scientist interested in contributing tools to the ecosystem we're generating - please get in touch
