Ox XChem is a two year project to enable the tools and culture needed for hit-to-lead in FBDD.
Utilising the world leading X-ray fragment screening facility at Diamond <a href="http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Beamlines/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html">(XChem)</a> - Ox XChem aims to build three core areas.
Easy-to-use computational tools to design follow-up compounds. Efficient acquisition of follow-up compounds and improved screening libraries. Assays to provide rapid feedback from those compounds.
